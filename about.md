My name is Riley Wheadon, and I am a second year undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. This blog is my journey to become a better programmer, student, and person with a focus on:
1. Documenting my personal projects.
2. Sharing my thoughts on studying and digital minimalism.

If you're interested, here is my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/rileywheadon), [github](https://github.com/rileywheadon), and <a href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
