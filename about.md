# about

My name is Riley Wheadon, a second year undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. I am currently pursuing a dual honours degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, with the hope of working in data science. I created this site to:
1. Document my personal projects.
2. Share my experiences as a student.

If you're interested, here is my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/rileywheadon), [github](https://github.com/rileywheadon), and <a href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
