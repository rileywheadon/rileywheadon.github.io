# about

**Who am I?** I'm Riley Wheadon, a second year undergraduate student pursuing a dual honours degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. After completing my degree, I want to go to grad school before finding work in data science or computer graphics.

**What is this?**: I created this site to document my personal projects and share my experiences as a student, in place of a more traditional medium like LinkedIn.

If you're interested, here is my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/rileywheadon), [github](https://github.com/rileywheadon), and <a href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
