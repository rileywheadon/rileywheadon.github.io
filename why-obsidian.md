# Why Obsidian?

Open your favourite note-taking app and click through the various menus and buttons. Ask yourself: *"How much of this do I use?"*. 

Be honest with yourself. Google docs has 6 different types of bullet points. How many times have you put a star or a right arrow in your notes?

<div style="text-align: center"><img width="300" src="/assets/images/bullets.png"></div>


If you're anything like me, the answer is zero. Now ask yourself these questions:
- How often do you "reformat" your notes?
- How many times have you tried to add an image to your notes only to cause weird unintended text wrapping?
- How many times have you needed to include a code snippet or a math equation in your notes?

This is why I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for nearly everything, including this blog post. Obsidian notes are stored as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files. Markdown allows you to bold and italicise text, and create links, lists, and headers.  You can also write code snippets and mathematical equations, as shown below.

```
print("Hello world!")
```

\\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]

However, Markdown doesn't make it easy to change the font, font size, or anything else. Some people might find this restrictive. I find it liberating. Markdown has *everything you need, and nothing you don't*.
